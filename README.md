# âš¡ Quick Note
Parts of this code were cleaned up using AI tools to make it easier to read and better organized, especially, you will observe that the names of the iterators now will start making sense, and so will the formulas. The actual logic, equations, and methods are exactly the same as the original work, only the structure and clarity were improved.
